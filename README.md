# Wide-Residual-Network

Wide-Residual-Networks are a modification of the Residual Networks. Deep Residual networks were shown to be able to scale up the number of layers and still have
improving performance. But with each fraction of increase in accuracy cost nearly doubling the number of layers in the network. Proposed by Sergey Zagoruyko, Nikos Komodakis,
WideResNets tackle these problems.
